  About the MaxMind database

      The MaxMind database is a subscription-based set of data files which
	  provide geographical data for IP addresses. The full set of MaxMind
	  data includes information such as organization, region, city, lat-long,
	  country code, and country. 


  Windows PowerShell and the MaxMind Cmdlet

      Windows PowerShell implements MaxMind functionality through the GeoLocPSCmdlet
	  module for Windows PowerShell. The module loads a MaxMind-specific 
      cmdlet, which you can use to retrieve geo-loc data from the MaxMind
	  database.
 
      When the GeoLocPSCmdlet module for Windows PowerShell is loaded, the following 
      MaxMind cmdlet is available.
